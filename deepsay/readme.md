The Dockerfile you've shared creates an image based on Ubuntu Jammy, installs `cowsay`, copies a custom cow file `deep.cow`, and updates the path to include `/usr/games` where `cowsay` is located. It includes an `ENTRYPOINT` and a `CMD` configuration for running `cowsay` with flexibility for user inputs.

Hereâ€™s how the configurations work:

### 1. **Custom Message**
The user can run the container with a custom message by providing the full command:

```bash
docker run deepsay cowsay -f deep.cow "Custom Message"
```

This works because the user overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` settings when providing their own command.

---

### 2. **Hardcoded `Hello`**
The `ENTRYPOINT` appends "Hello" to whatever custom message the user provides. If the user only provides additional arguments, they will be appended to "Hello". For example:

```bash
ENTRYPOINT ["cowsay", "-f", "deep.cow", "Hello"]
```

Running the container with:

```bash
docker run deepsay "World"
```

Produces:

```
 _______
< Hello World >
 -------
```

---

### 3. **User Always Provides Input**
The `ENTRYPOINT` mandates the user to always supply input when running the container. No default value is provided:

```bash
ENTRYPOINT ["cowsay", "-f", "deep.cow"]
```

If the user runs the container without a message:

```bash
docker run deepsay
```

The container will fail because `cowsay` expects input.

---

### 4. **Default Value with Customizable Input**
The `ENTRYPOINT` provides the core functionality (`cowsay` with the custom cow file), while `CMD` provides a default argument (`Hello`). If the user supplies their own message, it overrides `CMD`.

```bash
CMD ["Hello"]
ENTRYPOINT ["cowsay", "-f", "deep.cow"]
```

Examples:
- Default message:

  ```bash
  docker run deepsay
  ```

  Produces:

  ```
   _______
  < Hello >
   -------
  ```

- Custom message:

  ```bash
  docker run deepsay "Custom Message"
  ```

  Produces:

  ```
   _______________
  < Custom Message >
   ---------------
  ```

This setup offers flexibility, providing a sensible default while allowing user customization.
